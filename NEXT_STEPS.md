# Next Steps - Creative Technologists Platform

**Status:** Security hardening complete ‚úÖ | Admin dashboard enhanced ‚úÖ | Payment system configured ‚úÖ

**Date:** October 24, 2025

> **Recent Updates (Oct 24, 2025):**
> - Admin dashboard now shows ALL Discord members (not just paid subscribers)
> - Payment status indicators added to member cards
> - Stripe price configured for $299/month recurring subscriptions
> - `getAllSubscriptions()` query enhanced to fetch all subscription statuses

> **Testing caveats:** Latest automated suites rely on mocked services. Real Stripe Checkout/webhook delivery, Discord bot role sync, and Resend email flows still need live integration runs before go-live.

---

## üéâ Latest Enhancements (Oct 24, 2025)

### Admin Dashboard - Payment Status Visibility

**Problem:** Admin "Current Members" section only showed users with active subscriptions in database. Manually added Discord members or users with payment issues were invisible.

**Solution:** Complete redesign of member display logic:

1. **Show ALL Discord members** - Fetches from `member_status` table (bot-synced Discord roster)
2. **Merge with subscription data** - Joins with `subscriptions` table to check payment status
3. **Visual payment indicators** - Each member card shows:
   - üü¢ **Paid** - Green badge for active subscription
   - üü° **No Payment Record** - Amber badge for Discord members without subscription
4. **Smart sorting** - Paid members first, then sorted by recent activity
5. **Accurate stats** - Overview shows "X paid, Y unpaid" breakdown

**Files Changed:**
- `./app/admin/page.tsx:134-194` - Member list building logic
- `./app/admin/page.tsx:625-687` - Payment status badges in UI
- `./app/admin/page.tsx:240-265` - Overview statistics
- `./lib/db.ts:558-576` - `getAllSubscriptions()` query enhancement

**Testing:**
```bash
# Start dev server and visit admin dashboard
npm run dev
# Navigate to http://localhost:3000/admin
# Check "Current Members" section shows all Discord users
# Verify payment status badges (green = paid, amber = no payment)
```

### Stripe Configuration - Recurring Subscriptions

**Problem:** Stripe price was configured as ONE-TIME payment ($199) but code expects RECURRING subscriptions.

**Solution:**
1. Created new recurring price: `price_1SLnkmLp0ctwZDdXTF16gXdp` ($299/month)
2. Updated `.env` with correct `STRIPE_PRICE_ID`
3. Enhanced `isSubscriptionActive()` to handle all subscription statuses (active, past_due, canceled, incomplete, unpaid)

**Testing Required:** Complete end-to-end payment flow test (see below)

---

## ‚úÖ What's Working (Happy Path)

The complete membership flow is fully functional:

1. **Application Submission** ‚úÖ
   - User authenticates with Discord OAuth
   - Submits application form
   - Application stored in database

2. **Admin Review** ‚úÖ
   - Admin logs in via Discord OAuth
   - Reviews pending applications
   - Approves application

3. **Payment Flow** ‚úÖ
   - Approval email sent with payment link
   - Payment token validated (one-time use, 7-day expiry)
   - Stripe Checkout creates $1 test subscription
   - Customer and subscription records created in database

4. **Discord Integration** ‚úÖ
   - User clicks "Join Discord (1-click)" on success page
   - OAuth authorizes with `identify` + `guilds.join` scopes
   - User automatically added to Discord server
   - Member role assigned immediately
   - Webhook processes Stripe events successfully

---

## üî¥ Critical: Edge Cases to Test

**üìã Full Testing Guide:** See `TESTING_GUIDE.md` for step-by-step instructions for all 27 test scenarios

These scenarios are **untested** and may have bugs:

### Subscription Lifecycle

- [ ] **Subscription Cancellation**
  - Cancel a test subscription in Stripe Dashboard
  - Verify `customer.subscription.deleted` webhook fires
  - Confirm role is removed from Discord via bot API
  - Check database `subscriptions.status` updated to `canceled`
  - User should appear in "Expired Members" section after `current_period_end`

- [ ] **Subscription Expiration**
  - Wait for `current_period_end` to pass on a canceled subscription
  - OR manually update `current_period_end` to past date in database
  - Run cron job: `curl http://localhost:3000/api/cron/sync-roles`
  - Verify role is removed from Discord
  - Check user moves from "Current Members" to "Expired Members"

- [ ] **Payment Failure (past_due)**
  - Simulate failed payment in Stripe
  - Verify `customer.subscription.updated` webhook fires with `status: past_due`
  - Confirm role is **kept** (grace period)
  - Check subscription status in database

- [ ] **Subscription Renewal**
  - Test that `invoice.payment_succeeded` webhook fires monthly
  - Verify role remains assigned
  - Check no duplicate role assignments

- [ ] **Manual Discord Removal**
  - Manually kick user from Discord server
  - User clicks "Join Discord (1-click)" again
  - Should be re-added with role (if subscription still active)

### Application Flows

- [ ] **Application Rejection**
  - Reject a pending application in admin
  - Verify status updates to `rejected`
  - Check user cannot access payment page (no token generated)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Missing:** Rejection email not implemented

- [ ] **Application Waitlist**
  - Waitlist a pending application in admin
  - Verify status updates to `waitlisted`
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Missing:** Waitlist email not implemented

- [ ] **Duplicate Application**
  - User submits application twice
  - Should be blocked by unique constraint on `discord_user_id`
  - Verify friendly error message shown

- [ ] **Email Deliverability**
  - Add DKIM/SPF/DMARC records (Resend dashboard shows required DNS entries)
  - Consider using dedicated subdomain (e.g., `mail.rasp.club`) for transactional mail
  - Send follow-up approval email to confirm it lands in inbox (not spam)

- [ ] **Rate Limiting**
  - Submit 4 applications from same IP
  - 4th should be blocked by the application rate limiter
  - Verify 429 status returned

---

## üü° Important: Cron Job Setup

**Status:** Endpoint exists (`/api/cron/sync-roles`) but **not tested or scheduled**

### What the Cron Does

Daily synchronization to:
- Remove roles from expired subscriptions (`current_period_end` passed)
- Keep roles for active/past_due subscriptions
- Keep roles for canceled subscriptions until `current_period_end`
- Handle edge cases (manual Discord removals, data drift)

### Testing Locally

```bash
# Test the endpoint manually
curl http://localhost:3000/api/cron/sync-roles

# Or with authentication (if CRON_SECRET is set)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your_cron_secret" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/cron/sync-roles
```

**What to Verify:**
- [ ] Logs show roles synced for each user
- [ ] Expired members have roles removed
- [ ] Active members keep roles
- [ ] Past_due members keep roles (grace period)
- [ ] Canceled but current (before period end) keep roles

### Production Setup

#### 1. Add Vercel Cron Configuration

Create `vercel.json` in project root:

```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/sync-roles",
      "schedule": "0 3 * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

This runs daily at 3 AM UTC.

#### 2. Add Cron Secret

In production `.env` (Vercel):
```bash
CRON_SECRET=generate_random_secret_here
```

Update the cron endpoint to require this secret:
```typescript
// In app/api/cron/sync-roles/route.ts
const authHeader = request.headers.get('authorization')
const expectedAuth = `Bearer ${process.env.CRON_SECRET}`
if (authHeader !== expectedAuth) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 })
}
```

#### 3. Monitoring

- [ ] Set up logging for cron execution (how many roles added/removed)
- [ ] Alert on failures (email/Slack)
- [ ] Track execution time
- [ ] Monitor for rate limit issues with Discord/Bot API

### Security Improvements Implemented (October 2025)

The following critical security vulnerabilities were identified and fixed before production deployment:

1. **Admin Cookie Forgery Prevention** ‚úÖ
   - **Issue**: Admin authentication relied on unsigned `discord_user` cookie that could be forged
   - **Fix**: Implemented HMAC-SHA256 signing/verification using `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`
   - **Files**: `lib/signed-cookies.ts`, `lib/admin-auth.ts`, `app/api/auth/discord/callback/route.ts`

2. **Cron Endpoint Security** ‚úÖ
   - **Issue**: `/api/cron/sync-roles` had optional authentication, allowing unauthorized role sync
   - **Fix**: Made `CRON_SECRET` required, endpoint returns 500 if not set
   - **Files**: `app/api/cron/sync-roles/route.ts`, `CLAUDE.md`

3. **Payment Token Retry Support** ‚úÖ
   - **Issue**: Tokens invalidated when checkout created, stranding users on abandoned/failed sessions
   - **Fix**: Token invalidation moved to `checkout.session.completed` webhook (after successful payment)
   - **Files**: `app/pay/[token]/page.tsx`, `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`, `lib/stripe.ts`

4. **Exposed Secrets in Documentation** ‚úÖ
   - **Issue**: Real secrets committed to `NEXT_STEPS.md` (BOT_API_KEY, NEXTAUTH_SECRET, etc.)
   - **Fix**: Replaced all exposed values with placeholders and generation instructions
   - **Files**: `NEXT_STEPS.md`

5. **Discord Join Database Access** ‚úÖ
   - **Issue**: Join callback created duplicate Supabase client, potential RLS issues
   - **Fix**: Centralized subscription query in `lib/db.ts` for consistent client usage
   - **Files**: `app/api/discord/join/callback/route.ts`, `lib/db.ts`

6. **Cron Job Scheduling** ‚úÖ
   - **Issue**: vercel.json missing - cron job wouldn't run in production
   - **Fix**: Created vercel.json with daily 3 AM UTC schedule
   - **Files**: `vercel.json` (new file)

---

## üîµ Optional: User Experience Improvements

### Email Notifications (Post-Launch)

**Currently Implemented:**
- ‚úÖ Approval email with payment link

**Missing:**
- [ ] Rejection email template
- [ ] Waitlist email template
- [ ] Payment receipt (Stripe handles this?)
- [ ] Subscription cancellation notice
- [ ] Payment failure warning
- [ ] Welcome email after Discord join

**Implementation:**
- Update `lib/resend.ts` with new email templates
- Call in respective API routes (reject, waitlist, etc.)

### User Dashboard (Future Enhancement)

Build a member dashboard at `/dashboard`:

- [ ] **View Subscription Status**
  - Current plan
  - Billing cycle dates
  - Payment method on file

- [ ] **Manage Subscription**
  - Cancel subscription (Stripe Customer Portal)
  - Update payment method
  - View billing history

- [ ] **Download Invoices**
  - List past invoices
  - PDF download links

**Implementation:**
- Use Stripe Customer Portal for most features
- Create new page: `app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Authenticate via Discord OAuth session
- Fetch subscription data from database

### Admin Enhancements

- [ ] **Bulk Actions**
  - Approve/reject multiple applications at once
  - Export applications to CSV

- [ ] **Analytics Dashboard**
  - Application conversion rate
  - Active subscriber count
  - Monthly recurring revenue (MRR)
  - Churn rate

- [ ] **Member Search**
  - Filter by status, join date, activity
  - Search by Discord username

---

## üìä Monitoring & Observability

### Error Tracking

- [ ] **Set up Sentry** (or similar)
  - Capture webhook failures
  - Track Discord API errors
  - Alert on payment processing issues

### Key Metrics to Track

**Application Funnel:**
- Applications submitted
- Approval rate
- Payment completion rate
- Discord join rate

**Subscription Metrics:**
- Active subscriptions
- Monthly recurring revenue (MRR)
- Churn rate
- Failed payment rate

**System Health:**
- Webhook delivery success rate
- Cron job execution success
- Bot API uptime
- Discord role assignment success rate

### Logging

Current logging is console-based. Consider:
- [ ] Structured logging (JSON format)
- [ ] Log aggregation (Datadog, LogTail, etc.)
- [ ] Separate log levels (debug, info, warn, error)

---

## üéØ Success Criteria

- [x] Discord join works reliably

---

## üìù Known Issues / Tech Debt

1. **Payment Token Query Performance**
   - Current: `SELECT * FROM payment_tokens` + bcrypt compare loop
   - Better: Index on `token_hash` for faster lookups
   - Impact: Low (few tokens at a time)

2. **Subscription Query in Join Callback**
   - Uses local Supabase client instead of shared helper
   - Should consolidate into `lib/db.ts`
   - Impact: Low (code organization)

3. **Missing Webhook Event Logging**
   - Events are processed but not logged to database
   - Consider adding `webhook_events` table for audit trail
   - Impact: Medium (debugging webhook issues)

4. **No Retry Logic for Failed Webhooks**
   - If webhook processing fails, event is lost
   - Stripe auto-retries, but we don't track failures
   - Impact: Medium (rare but possible)

5. **Bot API Single Point of Failure**
   - If Railway bot is down, role assignments fail silently
   - Consider adding retry queue (e.g., Inngest, QStash)
   - Impact: Medium (affects user experience)

3. **Test application edge cases**
   - Rejection flow
   - Waitlist flow
   - Duplicate application blocking
   - Rate limiting (4th attempt blocked)

**After Testing Complete:**
4. **Prepare production environment** (Stripe live mode, domains)
5. **Deploy to production** (Vercel + Railway)
6. **Monitor first real transactions**
