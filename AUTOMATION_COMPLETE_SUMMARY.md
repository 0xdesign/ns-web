# Automated Testing Complete - Summary

**Date:** October 17, 2025
**Phase 1 Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Next:** Phase 2 Manual Verification

---

## What Was Automated and Tested

### ✅ Security Implementation (CRON_SECRET)

**Added:**
- Generated secure CRON_SECRET (64-char hex)
- Added to `.env` file
- Server restarted to load environment variable

**Tests Completed:**
1. ✅ No authentication → 401 Unauthorized
2. ✅ Wrong authentication → 401 Unauthorized
3. ✅ Correct authentication → 200 OK (processed 2 subscriptions)

**Files:**
- `app/api/cron/sync-roles/route.ts:7-27`
- `.env` (CRON_SECRET added)

---

### ✅ UI Testing with Playwright

**Pages Tested:**
1. ✅ Apply page (`/apply`) - Discord OAuth button functional
2. ✅ Admin login (`/admin/login`) - OAuth parameters correct
3. ✅ Members directory (`/members`) - 43 members loaded successfully

**Screenshots Saved:**
- `.playwright-mcp/test-apply-page.png`
- `.playwright-mcp/test-admin-login.png`
- `.playwright-mcp/test-members-directory.png`

**Verified:**
- Database connection working
- RLS policies allow public read access
- Bot-written data readable by web app
- Discord OAuth URLs correctly formatted

## Critical Security Findings (From Codex Analysis)

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** The following issues were identified and require action before production:

### 1. HIGH - Admin Cookie Security ✅ ALREADY FIXED

**Issue:** Admin authentication could be forged via unsigned cookies.

**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - HMAC-SHA256 signature implemented in security hardening phase.

**Files:** `lib/admin-auth.ts`, `app/api/auth/discord/callback/route.ts`

---

### 2. HIGH - Exposed Secrets in Documentation

**Issue:** Real API keys visible in `NEXT_STEPS.md:964, 1013`

**Action Required:**
```bash
# Rotate these secrets immediately:
- BOT_API_KEY (line 964, 1013)
- Any other real secrets in NEXT_STEPS.md

# Then update the file with placeholders
```

**Files:** `NEXT_STEPS.md` (lines 964, 1013)

---

### 3. HIGH - Missing CRON_SECRET in Production Env List

**Issue:** `CRON_SECRET` added to `.env` but not documented as required production variable.

**Action Required:**
- Add `CRON_SECRET` to production environment variable list in `NEXT_STEPS.md`
- Document that Vercel Cron must send `Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET` header
- Add to Vercel dashboard before deployment

**Note:** This has been implemented locally but needs production configuration.

---

### 4. MEDIUM - Payment Token Edge Case

**Issue:** Abandoned/failed Stripe Checkout sessions leave tokens invalid with no retry path.

**Current Behavior:**
- Token marked as "used" when Checkout session created
- If session expires or 3DS fails, user is stranded
- No way to regenerate or reuse token

**Action Required:**
- Test `checkout.session.expired` webhook
- Document token regeneration process
- Consider keeping token valid until `checkout.session.completed`

**Files:** `app/pay/[token]/page.tsx:98`

---

### 5. MEDIUM - Supabase RLS for Discord Join

**Issue:** Discord join callback queries Supabase with anon key - RLS policy must allow SELECT.

**Action Required:**
- Verify RLS policy on `subscriptions` table allows public SELECT where needed
- Test in production environment
- Consider switching to service role key for this route

**Files:** `app/api/discord/join/callback/route.ts:16-27`

---

### 6. MEDIUM - Monitoring Not Required

**Issue:** Monitoring marked as "optional" in deployment plan.

**Recommendation:** Make monitoring **required** for production:
- Vercel function errors and cron job failures
- Stripe webhook delivery status
- Railway bot API health
- Discord role assignment failures

**Current Status:** Only console logging (no alerts)

**Files:** `NEXT_STEPS.md:1122`

---

## What's Ready for Phase 2 (Manual Testing)

### ✅ Verified and Ready
- CRON_SECRET implementation working
- All UI pages load correctly
- Database connection established
- Bot API responding (health check passed)
- Discord OAuth URLs configured
- Members directory functional

### ⏳ Requires Manual Testing
- Discord OAuth flow (full authentication)
- Application submission with CAPTCHA
- Admin workflows (approve/reject/waitlist)
- Payment flow with Stripe Checkout
- Stripe webhook simulation
- Discord role assignment/removal
- Subscription lifecycle scenarios
- Email delivery verification
- Mobile responsiveness testing

---

## Recommended Next Actions

### Immediate (Before Manual Testing)
1. **Rotate secrets** - Change BOT_API_KEY and any real secrets in NEXT_STEPS.md
2. **Update documentation** - Add CRON_SECRET to production env requirements
3. **Review security findings** - Address payment token and RLS concerns

### Phase 2: Manual Testing (~1 hour)
Follow `MANUAL_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md` to verify:
- Critical path (30 min)
- Subscription lifecycle (20 min - optional)
- UI verification (10 min)
- Mobile testing (CRITICAL - mobile-first design)

### Before Production Deployment
1. Configure all environment variables in Vercel
2. Set up monitoring and alerts
3. Test cron job scheduling
4. Verify Stripe webhook delivery
5. Complete RLS policy review
6. Mobile testing on real devices
